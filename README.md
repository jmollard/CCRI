Combination of all code/documents personally used in the production of the CCRI data reports by UNICEF (2020-2023)
This is not a complete program, nor is it intended to be (or ever be)
This is a back-up of code run on various platforms and requires data to be available at the original points, with silly requirements for conda environments
If you do use these scripts, or functions, or anything from this, may God help you. I accept no responsibility if it doesn't work.

Description of folders (being updated):

python_codes: set of all python codes - these will slowly be weeded out until only working ones and non-repeating ones remain
